About this Documentation
------------------------

You may have noticed that I’m using [<span class="underline">Google Docs</span>](https://docs.google.com/). I realize that this is unusual for an open source project. If you [<span class="underline">take offense to this</span>](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ledger-cli/u648SA1o-Ek/yom_P38FCAAJ), so you know, I do like text formats too: in graduate school I used [<span class="underline">LaTeX</span>](http://www.latex-project.org/) extensively, and for the last decade I was in love with the [<span class="underline">reStructuredText</span>](http://docutils.sourceforge.net) format, I even wrote Emacs’ support for it. But something happened around 2013: [<span class="underline">Google Docs</span>](https://docs.google.com/) became good enough to write solid technical documentation and I’ve begun enjoying its revision and commenting facilities extensively: I am hooked, I love it. For users to be able to suggest a correction or place a comment in context is an incredibly useful feature that helps improve the quality of my writing a lot more than patches or comments on a mailing-list. It also gives users a chance to point out passages that need improvement. I have already received orders of magnitude more feedback on documentation than on any of my other projects; it works.

It also looks really *good*, and this is helping motivate me to write more and better. I think maybe I’m falling in love again with WYSIWYG... Don’t take me wrong: LaTeX and no-markup formats are great, but the world is changing and it is more important to me to have community collaboration and a living document than a crufty TeX file slowly aging in my repository. My aim is to produce quality text that is easy to read, that prints nicely, and most especially these days, that can render well on a mobile device or a tablet so you can read it anywhere. I’m also able to edit it while I’m on the go, which is fun for jotting down ideas or making corrections. Finally, Google Docs has an API that provides access to the doc, so should it be needed, I could eventually download the meta-data and convert it all to another format. I don’t like everything about it, but what it offers, I really do like.

If you want to leave comments, I’d appreciate if you can **log into your Google account** while you read, so that your name appears next to your comment. Thank you!
